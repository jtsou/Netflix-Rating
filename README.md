# Netflix Rating
Explore the distribution of rating on Netflix shows

<h2> Background </h2>
<p> Netflix has become a primary source of streaming media and video-on-demand online within the past few years. With this popularity, the provider would add more shows. However, what kind of shows do the viewers prefer -- since Netflix would cater to the viewers' need for potential new additions. With that said, this data analytics project dive into the reason behind the distribution of the ratings. </p>

<h2> Data Source </h2>
<p> I obtained the dataset from Data.world, in which the user took advantage of Netflix's suggestion engine. The suggestion engine recommends shows similar to the selected show. As part of this data set, the user took 4 videos from 4 ratings (totaling 16 unique shows), then pulled 53 suggested shows per video. The ratings include: G, PG, TV-14, TV-MA. I chose not to pull from every rating (e.g. TV-G, TV-Y, etc.).
